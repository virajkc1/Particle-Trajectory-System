# DEM Particle Trajectory Model
## Design and conduct a ‘home experiment’ to measure the restitution coefficient of an object using particle tracking velocimetry, Python

### Libraries:
• Numpy
• Pandas
• Matplotlib

### Specifications:
• a sensible choice of object, background and surface
• a sensible experimental set-up (lighting, filming angle, size reference etc.)
• a well-chosen set of experiments to perform (chosen drop height(s), number of repeats etc.)
• use of suitable image processing methods
• the generality of the code (could it be easily applied to another data set, or is it specific to your
data?)
• The method used to calculate the restitution coefficient from your data (what are your assump-
tions?)
• Use of any advanced analysis techniques (e.g. optimisation)
